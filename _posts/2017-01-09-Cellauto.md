What is a cellular automaton ?

The idea of a cellular automaton was first discussed by von neumann in 1966, in his paper [1] he describes a regular grid of cells each in one of a finte number of states, such as live and dead, that is able to change it's states and depending on the neighbouring cells. The most famous cellular automaton is conway game of life [2].

What made conway game of life so intriguing to many was the fact that life-like creates could be generated from 4 simple rules.

~~~
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
