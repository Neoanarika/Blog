What is a cellular automaton ?

The idea of a cellular automaton was first discussed by von neumann in 1966, in his paper [1] he describes a regular grid of cells each in one of a finte number of states, such as live and dead, that is able to change it's states and depending on the neighbouring cells. The most famous cellular automaton is conway game of life [2].
